  This is a boilerplate NestJS project working with PostgreSQL
</h1>
<p>
  Feel free to use this project, I think it has quite the simple setup for doing a lot of projects.
  More is to be added to this project for scaling purposes you might need in the future.
  Below are the list of things I am going to add to the stack
</p>
<h3>ELK Stack for logging purposes</h3>
<h3>Redis for Caching</h3>
<h3>Redis for Queue Messaging</h3>
